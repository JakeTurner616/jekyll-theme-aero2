# Aero2

Aero2 is a **design-first** jekyll web theme built around layout, typography, and interaction the way **printed media** and **early web UI** did — with strong rules, obvious structure, and confident hierarchy - while still respecting modern expectations for responsiveness, accessibility, and performance.

---

## Intentional simplicity

Aero2 avoids features that dilute the design:

- No animation for animation’s sake
- No “component soup”
- No hidden interactions

If something moves, collapses, or changes state, it does so **clearly and predictably**.

This makes the theme easy to extend, easy to read, and hard to break.

## Who this theme is for

Aero2 works best for:
- Writing-heavy sites
- Journals, and documentation
- Projects that value clarity
- People who want their site to feel *designed*, not assembled

---

## The goal

Aero2 is trying to look **confident**, **legible**, and **considered** —  
and to keep working the same way for a long time.
