# Aero2

[Aero2](https://github.com/JakeTurner616/jekyll-theme-aero2/) is a **design-first** jekyll web theme built around layout, typography, and interaction the way **printed media** and **early web UI** did, while still respecting modern expectations for responsiveness, accessibility, SEO, and performance.

## Intentional simplicity

Aero2 avoids features that dilute the design:

- No animations
- No “component soup”  
- No hidden interactions  
- Light and dark mode


If something moves, collapses, or changes state, it does so **clearly and predictably**.

The use of **jQuery is intentional** to align with the theme’s old-web sensibility

This makes the theme easy to extend, easy to read, and hard to break.

## What this theme is for

Aero2 works best for:
- Writing-heavy sites
- Journals, and documentation
- Projects that value clarity
- Customizablility as a dual column layout base template.

## The goal

Aero2 is trying to look **confident**, **legible**, and **considered** —  
and to keep working the same way for a long time.
