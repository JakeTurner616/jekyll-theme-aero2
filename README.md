# Aero2 — Jekyll Theme

**Aero2** is a design-first Jekyll theme built around **layout, typography, and clarity** — inspired by printed media and early web UI, but implemented with modern Jekyll best practices.

The goal is not to be flashy or over-engineered, but to feel **confident, legible, and durable**.

---

## Philosophy

Aero2 intentionally avoids features that dilute design:

- No animation for animation’s sake  
- No component soup  
- No hidden or ambiguous interactions  

If something moves, collapses, or changes state, it does so **clearly and predictably**.

This keeps the theme:
- Easy to extend
- Easy to reason about
- Hard to accidentally break

---

## Best Use Cases

Aero2 works best for:

- Writing-heavy sites
- Journals and blogs
- Documentation
- Personal or project sites that value structure and hierarchy
- Anyone who wants their site to feel *designed*, not assembled

---

## Installation

### 1. Add the theme to your Gemfile

```ruby
gem "jekyll-theme-aero2"
